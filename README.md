A python web crawler that downloads Volumes 1-20 of OnePunchMan from the internet so you don't have to 

Saves the tedium of clicking through each individual chapter and means internet connection is not required. 

Uses both the Python requests library: https://realpython.com/python-requests/ 
and the beautiful soup parser: https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/

The program creates the necessary directory substructer to organise by volume and chapter in the same folder as itself. 

Improvements:
The current code is overly long, and some optimisation could definitely be done.
The current version only works for a Windows folder structure
